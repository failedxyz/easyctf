Everyone complains that my problems are too random. Fine. Here is EXACTLY how to solve this problem.

1. Wow I have an image. I wonder why it’s so big (read: grandma, what large eyes you have)
2. So you figured that part out. Great, there’s a password. I wonder what that has to do with this image. Or wait, I could just brute force it, right? Either way works. It’s called reading the problem description. Or even the title. Titles do matter.
3. Yay, 2 images. What’s the difference? Hmmmm, I wonder what would happen if I expressed that difference pictorially. 
4. Well I got some stuff, but it makes no sense. Oh wait, maybe I need a key! Let’s go back to that thing we extracted earlier, shall we? Maybe those discrepancies are ACTUALLY USEFUL. Nothing is an accident, not even random out of place pixels. Check them. Carefully.
5. What do I do with this message and key? How about, the most obvious thing in every CTF ever. Seriously.

So you got the flag. Congrats! See, it wasn’t that bad.
