	<h2>Why Capture the Flag?</h2>
</div>

<p>No, we're not running around in a gym, tagging other players. <b>Capture the flag</b> contests, or CTFs for short, are intense cybersecurity contests where participants try to capture a piece of information. To do this, they must use skills to capture a <i>virtual</i> flag, usually taking the form of a string, like this: <code>flag{this_is_a_flag}</code>. There are two common types of CTF competitions: <b>jeopardy</b>, and <b>attack-defense</b>.</p>
<p>CTFs are different from the hacking you may hear from the news. While hacking is commonly associated with stealing and destruction, CTFs are all about learning and community.</p>
