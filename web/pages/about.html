<h1>About EasyCTF</h1>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">What?! Hacking?</h3>
<p>Yup. You heard that right. EasyCTF is a online hacking/cybersecurity contest targeted at middle and high school students. Like many similar CTF competitions, participants will have to crack, decompile, decrypt, etc. through many defenses in order to find a secret message, known as the "flag". The challenges presented are designed with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent and legal way for students to get some great hands-on experience.</p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">How many people per team?</h3>
<p>Teams will consist of up to 5 members. There's no point advantage to having less people on your team, but it's definitely to your advantage to have more people helping you, so invite your friends to play along!</p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Help, I don't know anything!</h3>
<p>That's ok! Like its name suggests, EasyCTF is an intro-level CTF contest, but can be enjoyable for new and veteran hackers alike! With the "programming" category, those without prior knowledge of computer science or programming can get some of the foundational skills required to solve some of the later challenges.</p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">Wait, can't I just look this stuff up?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. In fact, we encourage you to use whatever resources you have, as long as it complies with our rules. CTF contests are created with the intention of allowing participants to look up information about topics they aren't familiar with. Our goal here is to open the door to cybersecurity and computer science for young and prospective hackers, and being able to find the information you want through searching the Internet is a great skill to have.</p>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">What are the rules?</h3>

<h3 class="ui dividing header">How can I prepare?</h3>
<p>To get a feel for what you'll be doing during the actual competition, you could try some of the practice problems below, or try some of the problems from last year's EasyCTF.</p>
