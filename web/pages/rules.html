    <h2 class="heading2">Rules</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Below lie the rules regarding EasyCTF. These rules have been specifically formulated in order to preserve the integrity of the competition for every participant. These rules exist only serve as a auxillary to your own common sense. One of EasyCTF's core
        goals is to gauge your team's understanding of the relevant computer science principles. If we wanted to measure the magnitude of your teacher's knowledge of computer science, we would attend a local CSTA meeting. Due to the nature of the competition's
        content, the whole of the world wide web is free game. Do not, however, use forums or other services in which the problem is forwarded to unregistered member of EasyCTF. Sharing flags is obviously against rules, and will not be permitted. Do not
        confuse EasyCTF with an attack-defense CTF platform; if you attack either the EasyCTF infrastructure or another team, you will be subject to complete team explusion, as well as the possibility of legal pursuance. All decisions made by an administrator
        from the EasyCTF Team are final.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Flag Format</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Similar to previous years, our flags will be formatted like so:
        <code>EasyCTF{example_flag}</code>. Although our magical judge programs are expecting only the text in between the curly braces (
        <code>example_flag</code>), EasyCTF will ignore the
        <code>EasyCTF{}</code> and mark your submission correct or incorrect. Rapid, repeated guesses (brute forcing) will serve as sufficient grounds for team penalization. As forementioned, sharing of flags outside members of your own team can, and will have
        severe penalties or explusion from the CTF competition. Finally, creating writeups for your solved problems is highly encouraged. However, for the integrity of the competition, writeups may not be posted before the end of the competition. After
        the competition has successfuly ended, the EasyCTF team will post writeups for all of the problems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Scoring</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">In EasyCTF, every problem has an assigned point value. This point value is assigned based on the difficulty or the extent of time required to solve the problem. Your team's total score is the sum of the points you obtain from every problem you solve.
        A few problems may have speed bonuses, meaning that the first solve on a problem will earn a bonus percent of the original problem value. These bonus points will also count toward your team total. Here is a screenshot from the problems page to
        demonstrate. Teams with higher points will outrank teams with lower points. Should a tie occur between two teams, the time of the last submission will be used to break the tie. For example, if two teams are tied at 100 points, the team that reached
        100 points first will outrank the team that reached 100 points afterwards.</p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Eligibility and Observer Accounts/Teams</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">EasyCTF is targeted at students enrolled in high schools or middle schools across the United States. Therefore, only students who are enrolled in high schools or middle schools in the United States are eligible for prizes. The EasyCTF Team will verify
        the winning teams meet these conditions; if a winning team does not meet these conditions, then the prizes will be given to the next highest team. If you don't live in the United States, or you're not a high school or middle school student, you
        are still encouraged to compete, but under an Observer account. Teams with at least one Observer member will be considered an Observer team. Observer teams still appear in the scoreboard, but are not eligible for prizes. Teachers also wishing
        to take part in the CTF may also create an Observer team.</p>
