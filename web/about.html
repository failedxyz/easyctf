      <h2 style="font-size: 2.5em;">Why Capture the Flag?</h2>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Capture the Flag? Hope you brought your gym clothes! Just kidding. This time we promise no one will end up with a floor burn. Capture the flag contests, or CTFs for short, are intense cybersecurity contests that take place all over the world. To hit the top of the scoreboard, participants (and their teammates) must capture a piece of information, known as a flag. All of our problems will, after a little bit of this and that, will provide you with a flag which you can submit for points. Harder problems are worth more points. With most CTFs, it can be hard to determine whether or not you have the flag. Sometimes it's a long string of numbers or letters and it's hard to distinguish from the sorrounding code. Here at EasyCTF, our flags -- when you find them -- will look something like this: <code style="background-color:#FFFEEA;color:#FF4D4D;">flag{this_is_a_flag}</code>. Simply enter in the data between the curly braces (case-insensative) and you'll get your due points. The more flags you find, and the harder flags you find, the easier it will be for you to move up the scoreboard. If you are in one of the highest scoring teams at the end of the competition, your team will win bragging rights, and some pretty cool prizes.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 2.5em;">Isn't Hacking Illegal?</h2>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Yes and no. Despite the connotation "hacking" has recieved in contemporary culture and media, hacking is more or less split up into two categorizations, <i>Black Hat</i> and <i>White Hat</i>. Black Hat hackers are the ones you hear about on the news; attacking websites and their accounts to steal information or money. They attack without warning, all for their own benefit. Black Hat hackers go to prison. White Hat hackers, while rarely in the news, are the men and women who, <b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">with permission</span></b>, attack a website or service in order to find holes in the security and report them to the owners for patching. The types of hacking you will be doing in the competition are created by the EasyCTF team just for you. Take part in EasyCTF to show off your skills as a white hat hacker.</p>
