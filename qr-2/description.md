When I am not practicing my [Oboe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oboe) for band, I have been working on a QR code generator. For some reason, some of the images are not scannable. [Here](${qr2_bmp}) is one, can you tell me what it says?

NOTE: Due to a flag leak, this is a re-release of the problem with a new flag.
