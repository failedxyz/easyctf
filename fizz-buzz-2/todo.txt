I still need to do the execution grader, and probably introduce some sort of limits to prevent the contestant from having a print "1,2,fizz,4,buzz..." type program. A length limit would probably be sufficient.

I also need to add a program validator, that checks for the characters "i", "I", and "?".

We will need to disable "eval()", "exec()", globals (in python), etc.

Backup hint: `Don't use the characters "i", "I", and "?".`
