Write a program that outputs the numbers 1 through n, in incremental order, one per line. 

However, replace any line that is a multiple of 3 with "Fizz" and any that are a multiple of 5 with "Buzz". Any line that is a multiple of 3 and 5 should be written as "FizzBuzz".

The input will be the number of lines to write, n, followed by a linebreak.

Sample output:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz

...

13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17

...
```
